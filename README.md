# 100 Days of Programming Series

Welcome to the **100 Days of Programming Series**! 🚀

This repository is a collection of daily programming challenges that I am working on as part of my **100 Days of Code** journey. Each day, I tackle a new programming concept or problem, implementing solutions in multiple programming languages including:

- **C**
- **C++**
- **Java**
- **Python**
- **JavaScript**

## **What is this series about?**

The **100 Days of Programming Series** is designed to:

- Enhance problem-solving skills.
- Strengthen understanding of programming fundamentals.
- Explore algorithms and their implementation in different languages.
- Build consistency in coding every day.

Each day focuses on a specific topic or problem, starting from basic concepts and gradually progressing to more advanced topics.

## **Structure of the Repository**

Each day has its own folder containing:

1. **Problem Description**: A markdown file explaining the problem statement and examples.
2. **Solution Code**: Code files in C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.
3. **Bonus Challenges**: Additional tasks to expand the problem scope.

### **Example Structure:**

```
Day 1: Factorial
├── README.md  (Problem description)
├── factorial.c
├── factorial.cpp
├── factorial.java
├── factorial.py
└── factorial.js
```
