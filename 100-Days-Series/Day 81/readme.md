# ğŸ“˜ EvenOddSum Java Program

This Java program calculates the **sum of even** and **sum of odd numbers** separately from a list of integers provided by the user.

---

## ğŸš€ Features

* Accepts a user-defined number of integers as input.
* Separates even and odd numbers.
* Calculates and displays:

  * Sum of even numbers
  * Sum of odd numbers
* Uses modular functions for better code readability and reuse.

---

## ğŸ§  Concepts Covered

* **Methods in Java**: Two separate methods are used:

  * `getSumOfEvenNumber(int[] numbers)`
  * `getSumOfOddNumber(int[] numbers)`
* **Conditional Statements**: Used to check whether a number is even or odd using modulus `%`.
* **Loops**: `for` loop is used to iterate through the array of numbers.
* **Arrays**: User input numbers are stored in an integer array.
* **User Input**: `Scanner` class is used to take input from the user.

## ğŸ’¡ How it Works

1. The user is prompted to enter how many integers they want to input.
2. Those integers are stored in an array.
3. The program checks each number:

   * If itâ€™s even, it adds it to the **even sum**.
   * If itâ€™s odd, it adds it to the **odd sum**.
4. Both results are displayed separately at the end.

## ğŸ“ˆ Output Example

```
Enter the number of integers : 5
Enter 1 integer : 2
Enter 2 integer : 7
Enter 3 integer : 4
Enter 4 integer : 9
Enter 5 integer : 6
The Sum of Even integers is : 12
The Sum of Odd integers is : 16
```
