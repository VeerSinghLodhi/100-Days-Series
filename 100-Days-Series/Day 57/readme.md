# ðŸ”¢ Symmetric Number Pyramid Pattern (Palindromic)

## ðŸ“˜ Description

The **Symmetric Number Pyramid**, also known as a **Palindromic Number Pyramid**, is a popular pattern printing program where numbers increase to the center and then decrease, forming a symmetric or palindromic shape. This pattern helps beginners strengthen their understanding of nested loops and number logic.

## ðŸ“Š Pattern Example (For `n = 5`)

```
    1
   121
  12321
 1234321
123454321
```

---

## ðŸ§  Logic Breakdown

Each row consists of three main parts:

1. **Spaces**: `(n - i)` spaces to align the numbers to the center.
2. **Ascending Numbers**: From `1` to `i`.
3. **Descending Numbers**: From `i - 1` down to `1`.

This forms a pyramid that is symmetrical (palindromic) on both sides of the center.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

* Practice with **nested loops**
* Learn **left-padding with spaces**
* Understand **palindromic structure**
* Enhance control over **loop boundaries**
