**Multiplication Table Generator**

This program generates and prints the multiplication table for any given number entered by the user. The implementation is demonstrated for the following programming languages:
- C
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python

---

### ✨ How It Works:
1. **User Input:**
   - The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. **Table Generation:**
   - The entered number is processed using a loop.
   - The loop iterates through a fixed range (1 to 10).
   - For each iteration, the number is multiplied by the loop index.
   - The result of each multiplication is printed in a formatted output.

---

### 📌 Key Features:
- User-friendly: Accepts input interactively.
- Dynamic: Generates multiplication tables for any integer.
- Simple and efficient logic using loops.
- Cross-language compatibility: Can be implemented in multiple languages.

### ✅ Example:
#### Input:
```
Enter a number to print its multiplication table: 5
```
#### Output:
```
Multiplication table for 5:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```

### 🛠️ Logic Explanation:
1. **Accept Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input a number.
   - Store the input in a variable.
2. **Generate Table:**
   - Use a loop to iterate over a range (e.g., 1 to 10).
   - Multiply the input number by the loop counter during each iteration.
   - Format the output to display the multiplication process and result.

### 🚀 How to Run the Program:
1. Save the code to a file in your desired language.
2. Open your preferred terminal, IDE, or code editor.
3. Execute the program according to the conventions of the chosen language:
   - **C/C++:** Compile using a compiler (e.g., `gcc` or `g++`) and run the executable.
   - **Java:** Compile using `javac` and run using `java`.
   - **JavaScript:** Run directly in a browser console or using Node.js.
   - **Python:** Execute using the `python` or `python3` command.
4. Input a number when prompted, and the program will display its multiplication table.

### 📚 Learnings:
- Using loops for repetitive tasks.
- Accepting and processing user input interactively.
- Structuring programs to handle specific tasks efficiently.
- Implementing logic across multiple programming languages.

### 🙌 Want to Try More?
Modify the program to:
1. Print tables for a range of numbers (e.g., 2 to 5).
2. Save the tables to a text file instead of displaying them.
3. Add validation to ensure the input is a valid number.

Enjoy coding! 🎉
