# ðŸ”º Floydâ€™s Triangle Pattern

## ðŸ“˜ Description

**Floydâ€™s Triangle** is a number pattern arranged in a right-angled triangular format, starting from `1` and increasing consecutively. Each row contains an increasing count of numbers corresponding to the row number.

This pattern is widely used in beginner programming exercises to build understanding of nested loops and number sequences.

## ðŸ“Š Pattern Example (For `n = 5`)

```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
```

## ðŸ§  Logic Breakdown

* The triangle begins at `1` and each number increases by `1` from the previous.
* The number of elements in the `i-th` row is equal to `i`.
* A counter variable is used to track and print numbers in sequence.
* Two nested loops are used:

  * The **outer loop** handles the number of rows.
  * The **inner loop** prints the correct number of elements in each row.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

* Understanding **nested loop structures**
* Mastering **number sequences**
* Practicing **row-column logic**
* Developing pattern recognition and output formatting

## ðŸ“š Usage

* Entry-level programming practice
* Logical reasoning and pattern-based questions
* Building confidence in loop-based output formatting
