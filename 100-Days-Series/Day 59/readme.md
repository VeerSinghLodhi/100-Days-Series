## ðŸ“˜ Description

The **Inverted Half Number Pyramid** is a simple yet effective pattern used to practice nested loops and control structures. It displays numbers in a right-angled triangular format, starting from the highest number of elements in the first row and decreasing by one in each subsequent row.

## ðŸ“Š Pattern Example (For `n = 5`)

```
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 
1 2 
1 
```

## ðŸ§  Logic Breakdown

* The total number of rows is equal to the input `n`.
* The first row contains `n` numbers, and each subsequent row contains one less.
* For each row `i`, numbers are printed from `1` to `i`.
* This is achieved using **two nested loops**:

  * The **outer loop** runs from `n` down to `1` (rows).
  * The **inner loop** runs from `1` to `i` (columns/numbers).

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

* Practice with **reverse looping**
* Understanding row-wise decrementing patterns
* Familiarity with **nested for-loops**
* Enhances control over loop boundaries and flow

## ðŸ“š Usage

* Often used in coding practice and exams
* Great starting pattern to learn nested loops
* Builds a strong base for more complex number and star patterns
