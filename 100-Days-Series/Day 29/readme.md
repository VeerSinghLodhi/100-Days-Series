# 📝 CountWord - Java Word Counter

A basic Java project that counts the number of words in a sentence or paragraph. This project is ideal for beginners learning string manipulation, logic building, and Java fundamentals.

## 📌 Objective

To build a program that takes a line of text and accurately returns the number of words in it.

## 🧠 Logic Behind the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Accept a full line of text from the user or a predefined string.
   - Remove any leading or trailing spaces to avoid false word counts.

2. **Splitting the Sentence**:
   - Use space (`" "`) or whitespace-based separation logic to break the sentence into individual words.
   - Handle cases where multiple spaces may exist between words.

3. **Counting Words**:
   - Count the number of valid parts (words) obtained after splitting.
   - Display the total word count.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Empty input should return a count of 0.
   - Extra spaces or tabs between words should not affect the result.

## 🔍 Example

**Input:**  
`"Java is a powerful programming language."`

**Output:**  
`Word Count: 6`
