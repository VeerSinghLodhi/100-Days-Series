# Two Matrix Addition 🧮

## 📖 Introduction

Matrix addition is a fundamental operation in linear algebra where two matrices of the **same dimensions** are added together by adding their corresponding elements.

This operation is useful in various fields such as computer graphics, data analysis, physics, and engineering, where matrices are used to represent systems, transformations, or datasets.

## 🧠 Theory

### Condition:
Two matrices can only be added if they have the **same number of rows and columns** (i.e., same dimensions).

If `A` and `B` are two matrices of size `m x n`, then their sum `C = A + B` is also a matrix of size `m x n`, where:

```

C\[i]\[j] = A\[i]\[j] + B\[i]\[j]

```

for all `i` from `0 to m-1` and `j` from `0 to n-1`.

## 🔍 Example

Given:

```

Matrix A =        Matrix B =

\[ 1  2 ]           \[ 4  5 ]
\[ 3  4 ]           \[ 6  7 ]

```

Their sum:

```

Matrix C =

\[ 1+4  2+5 ]  =  \[ 5  7 ]
\[ 3+6  4+7 ]     \[ 9 11 ]

```

## ✅ Key Points

- Matrix addition is **element-wise**.
- Only matrices of **equal dimensions** can be added.
- The resulting matrix has the **same dimensions** as the original matrices.

## 📌 Applications

- Image processing (pixel-wise addition)
- Data analysis (combining datasets)
- Physics and engineering simulations
- Transformations in graphics and animations
