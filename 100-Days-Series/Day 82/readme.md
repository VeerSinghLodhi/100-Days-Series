## ðŸ“Œ Finding Indices of a Key in an Array (Using Recursion)

This Java program is designed to **find all occurrences of a specific key in an array using recursion**. It prints the **indices** where the key is found.

---

### ðŸ“‹ Description

The program defines a recursive method that:

* Takes the array, the key to search for, and the current index as input.
* Checks each element one by one recursively.
* Prints the index whenever the key matches the current element.

---

### ðŸ§  Core Logic

* If the current index equals the length of the array, recursion stops (base case).
* If the element at the current index matches the key, its index is printed.
* The function then calls itself recursively for the next index.

> Note: Although using `++index` in the recursive call works, using `index + 1` is more readable and avoids side effects.

### ðŸ§ª Sample Input

Array: `{3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 2, 2}`
Key: `2`

### âœ… Output

The output will be the indices where the key is found:
`1 5 7 8`

### ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. Save the file with a `.java` extension.
2. Compile and run it using any Java compiler or IDE.
