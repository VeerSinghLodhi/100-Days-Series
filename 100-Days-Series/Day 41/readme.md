## Theory: Multiplication of Two Matrices  

Matrix multiplication in programming involves combining two 2D arrays (matrices) to produce a new matrix.

* Two matrices can be multiplied only if the number of **columns in the first matrix** equals the number of **rows in the second matrix**.
* The resulting matrix has the number of **rows of the first matrix** and the number of **columns of the second matrix**.
* Each element of the resulting matrix is calculated by taking the **sum of products** of corresponding elements from the row of the first matrix and the column of the second matrix.
* Nested loops are usually used in code: an outer loop for rows, a middle loop for columns, and an inner loop to calculate the sum of products.

This approach is commonly used in programming for graphics, scientific calculations, and data processing.
